Temporal and spatial temperature measurement in a greenhouse - Agrotech course final project.


# Components

## Building the circuit

In order to build one measuring station we used the following parts:

1x ESP32.
2X RY-GH PHOTOSYNTHETICALLY EFFECTIVE RADIATION SENSOR

.
Write here the equipment we used
in order to assmble it on top of the prototype board we had to use some Male to Female mounts that were souldred to the board itself.
the finnished board looked like this:

## Our Circuit Diagram
the connections were made on the back of the board according to the schematics down below:
--ask Nadav/Guy to help us drow it

# Code & Thingspeak
## Preperation
in order to proceed with the code make sure the following libraries are installed:
write here the libraries

upload the next code to the ESP32 in order to see the DS18B20 code:
