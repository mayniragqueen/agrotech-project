## Building the circuit

In order to build one measuring station we used the following parts:

1. 1X ESP32
2. 2X RY-GH PHOTOSYNTHETICALLY EFFECTIVE RADIATION SENSORS
4. 1X BreadBord
5. 1X ADS1115 - ADC Analog to Digital Converter 
6. 2X Two Wires Conectors
7. 8X small Wires
8. 1X Plastic Enclosure Electronic Box 
.
Write here the equipment we used
in order to assmble it on top of the prototype board we had to use some Male to Female mounts that were souldred to the board itself.
the finnished board looked like this:

## Preperation
in order to proceed with the code make sure the following libraries are installed:
