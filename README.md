# Agrotech Project 2022
Measuring PAR outside and inside the greenhouse


# Components

## Building the circuit

In order to build one measuring station we used the following parts:

1. 1X ESP32
2. 2X RY-GH PHOTOSYNTHETICALLY EFFECTIVE RADIATION SENSORS
4. 1X BreadBord
5. 1X ADS1115 - ADC Analog to Digital Converter 
6. 2X Two Wires Conectors
7. 8X small Wires (Male)
8. 1X Plastic Enclosure Electronic Box 

the finnished board looked like this:

## Preperation
in order to proceed with the code make sure the following libraries are installed:
write here the libraries

upload the next code to the ESP32 in order to see the DS18B20 code:
